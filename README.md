Abstract: Aging is often associated with decline in brain processing power and neural predictive capabilities. To challenge this notion, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to record the whole-brain activity of 39 older adults (over 60 years old) and 37 young adults (aged 18-25 years) during recognition of previously memorised and varied musical sequences. Results revealed that when recognising memorised sequences, the brain of older compared to young adults reshaped its functional organisation. In fact, it showed increased early activity in sensory regions such as the left auditory cortex (100 ms and 250 ms after each note), and only moderate decreased activity (350 ms) in medial temporal lobe and prefrontal regions. When processing the varied sequences, older adults showed a reduction of the fast-scale functionality (250 ms after each note) of higher-order brain regions including hippocampus, ventromedial prefrontal and inferior temporal cortices, while no differences were observed in the auditory cortex. Accordingly, young outperformed older adults in the recognition of novel sequences, while no behavioural differences were observed with regards to memorised ones. Our findings show age-related neural changes in predictive and memory processes, integrating existing theories on compensatory neural mechanisms in non-pathological aging.
