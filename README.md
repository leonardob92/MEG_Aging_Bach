Abstract: Aging is often associated with decline in brain processing power and neural predictive capabilities. To challenge this notion, we used the excellent temporal resolution of magnetoencephalography (MEG) to record the whole-brain activity of 39 older adults (over 60 years old) and 37 young adults (aged 18-25 years) during recognition of previously memorised and novel musical sequences. Our results demonstrate that independent of behavioural measures, older compared to young adults showed increased rapid auditory cortex responses (around 100 and 250 ms after each tone of the sequence) and decreased later responses (around 250 and 350 ms) in hippocampus, ventromedial prefrontal cortex and inferior frontal gyrus. Working memory abilities were associated with stronger brain activity for both young and older adults. Our findings unpick the complexity of the healthy aging brain, showing age-related neural transformations in predictive and memory processes and challenging simplistic notions that non-pathological aging merely diminishes neural predictive capabilities.
